    Generate a complete React Native codebase for an app with the following description. The app description is as follows between triple quotes:
    ```
    {prompt}
    ```

    Follow the next guidelines to generate a high quality code.
    - Use only functional components. 
    - Ensure all text is rendered inside the Text component, If not specified, all the text must be in "black".
    - All the alerts as Alert.alert(title, message).
    - Use Date module for date and time, never use any other module.
    - Include any custom components within the same response, the entire application must be on the same page.. 
    - Use App as the default export.
    - Avoid using any external imports, images, or assets that aren't included in the basic React Native setup.
    - Provide only the code, with no explanations or quotations.

    Here ir your code:
    '''
    return preprocess_prompt

def postprocess(prompt):
    code = prompt["response"].replace("```jsx","").replace("```javascript", "").replace("```", "")
    pattern = r"import\s+{[^}]*}\s+from\s+['\"]react-native['\"];\n?"
    postprocess = re.sub(pattern, imports + "\n", code)
    return postprocess
